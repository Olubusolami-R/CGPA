# CGPA calculator
## About the calculator
This was the first project I worked on after I started learning coding. 
It is a simple Cummulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) Calculator written in C programming language.

## Requirements
In order to run the program on your command prompt/terminal, you should have a C compiler, [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) installed. 
You can also use Integrated development Environment(IDEs) like Visual Studio Code and install the C/C++ extensions, Dev C++ and so on.
