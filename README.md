# CGPA calculator
## About the calculator
This was the first project I worked on after I started learning coding. 
It is a simple Cummulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) Calculator written in C programming language which has an extra search feature.

## Requirements
In order to run the program on your command prompt/terminal, you should have a C compiler, [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) installed. 
You can also use Integrated development Environment(IDEs) like Visual Studio Code and install the C/C++ extensions, Dev C++ and so on. 

## How it works
When you run the program, you would be prompted to enter the semester number, then the number of courses. After that you would enter the quality units and grades for the courses. Your GPA and CGPA will then be displayed. 
You can choose to calculate for another semester, search for a semester's result or exit.

## What next
While I've worked on more projects in other languages at the time of writing this README, I will try to find some time to refactor the code.
